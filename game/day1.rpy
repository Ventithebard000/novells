    k "-looked interesting, but I don’t have too many friends who are interested...Rin wanted me to join her in archery club, but the whole shooting thing is kinda just not my speed."
    k "And Sora wanted me to join the skating club, but I’m afraid of the blade shoes, you know? And it conflicts with--hey, Yuuma, are you listening?"
    y "Huh? Oh yeah, I’m listening. You were talking about clubs right?"
    k "Just admit you weren’t listening..."
    "Yuuma looks down at his delicately crafted bento box."
    y "Well I tried a new recipe for this bento, and it doesn’t really mix too great with the other stuff in here. It’s a little too salty."
    y "I’ll have to try something new tomorrow.."
    k "Yuuma, you sound like a girl perfecting her chocolate recipe for Valentine’s Day. It’s time to sign up for clubs!"
    y "You know I’m not interested in any of the clubs. I’ve never been good at sports, and all the academic clubs sound incredibly boring."
    k "You say that every year, Yuuma…"
    y "If they want me to join, the clubs should just be more interesting."

    y "I guess it would be nice to have a change though..."
    k "I grabbed way too many of these club application forms though, I’m not going to use all of them."

    "Kyo reaches into her bag, and pulls out a stack of at least twenty club application fliers, before passing a couple to Yuuma."
    k "Here! Take some! You should join any club that interests you.."
    k "How about you take a peek?"
    "Yuuma briefly scans the list of clubs."
    y "I’m telling you, Kyo, these all sounds like such a waste of ti--"
    show yuuma default
    y "Anyway, there’s no way I could make time for these."
    show yuuma default
    "Yuuma tries to put the paper away, but can’t take his eyes off of ‘Cooking Club’"
    k "Well you should consider them! Every year you avoid joining clubs and end up with nothing to do."
    k "You should go out and socialize more!"
    y "Easy for you to say..."
    k "It’s not like you need to make friends with everyone in a club. As long as you have one person, that’s enough."
    k "In first year gardening club, I met Masao who gave me all of the midterm answers. It always works out some way or another. I always gave him my leftover dorayaki from lunch."
    show yuuma default
    y "You bribed him with sweets? You know Kyo, it’s not good that you only eat pastries at lunch."
    y "It’s not even noon and you’re eating a curry bun."
    y "You should bring an actual lunch to school; if your parents won’t make one you should teach yourself."
    k "But that’s so much work when I could just buy stuff from the student store. Between clubs, homework, socializing, and sleeping I don’t have time to make a nice bento box like yours."
    k "Where did you learn to cook bentos as fancy as yours anyway?"
    y "Ah, the dangers of club involvement."
    y "If I joined a club I wouldn’t have time to cook my bentos and I’d have to resort to student store bread, and I’d like to keep my dignity as a person."
    y "Unless I could somehow do both at once…"
    "Yuuma’s eyes are again drawn to the club sheet’s ‘Cooking Club’"
    show kyo default
    k "Wait...Yuuma...Are you thinking about joining a club?"
    y "No! I mean… I don’t know… I just thought if I was just cooking at school instead of home it wouldn’t be too much of a difference…"
    k "Cooking club?! You’re joining cooking club?!"
    k "Yuuma that’s great! I’m so happy you’re making this decision!"
    k "I am going to go turn in my club forms after school, you should join me!"
    show yuuma default
    y "Kyo! I didn’t say I was going to! Just thought about it!"
    k "This is going to be great! I’ve heard so many things about the club president! He seems so nice and I’m sure he’d love to have you!"
    k "And then you can introduce me!"
    y "Wait, I--"
    k "Here! I’ll help you fill it out!"
    "Kyo takes out a pen and fills out Yuuma’s information on the form"
    show yuuma default
    y "Well… I guess there is no getting out of this now..."

    y "I can’t believe you turned that into the office for me, Kyo…"
    k "It’s fine, isn’t it? You were going to do it anyways."
    y "You don’t know that."
    k "Yeah I do. I know you Yuuma, once you see something that interests you, you always go for it, even if you have to whine about it for a couple of days."

    k "I did you a favor ‘cause you’re so stubborn."
    y "I’ll never understand how you act so rashly. It takes you half a second to make up your mind."
    k "If the club is that bad you can always stop going."
    y "I guess so."
    y "Well, it is kind of exciting to start something new."
    y "If it is that bad you’ll have to pay, though."
    k "Understood! Operation Get Yuuma To Join A Club is in full motion!"
