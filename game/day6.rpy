    y "Alright. I’ll mix the batter so the consistency comes out right, and after the cake goes in the oven, I can make a frosting of some sort."
    k "What does Katsumi do?"
    y "Katsumi...Can take the cake in and out of the oven. He can also be our gopher if we need more ingredients or supplies."

    y "We work efficiently and swiftly."
    y "Make quick work of your task and proceed to the second."

    k "What if we mess up our jobs?"
    y "There ae backup assignments, but that’s a last resort."
    y "Since our recipe for the competition is easy, we should have a lot of extra time in case of any slip-ups."
    h "What if we run out of time?"
    y "Well we shouldn’t, but if that happens I guess we’ll just have to make what we have look presentable."
    k "What if we don’t have enough strawberries?!"
    y "Then Katsumi can go run and get more, but that’s not even an issue!"
    y "Look, if everyone sticks to the plan, it should go fine."
    y "We still have days to practice, we can pull this off."
    y "Everyone just needs to work together."
